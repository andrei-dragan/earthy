# üåç Earthy - Earth‚Äôs favorite social network
You may find a thorough description of the application, together with issues tackled during its development, in the attached manual, which, unfortunately, at the moment, is written only in Romanian.

## Why Earthy?

Dedicated especially to saving the planet, Earthy is not just a simple social network for those who want to help the environment. Earthy is a community that encourages, motivates, and offers opportunities to all people who want to do good for the planet we live on. Because a good deed, no matter how small, can have a positive impact: on you, on others, and, of course, on the world around you.

Earthy is a unique platform at the moment. Starting from the ideas of existing networks: Facebook and Twitter, Earthy combines all of this with strong interactivity with the user through the help of gamification: experience, level, points, badges, etc., all of which are focused on a category of people who want to do good to the Planet, to help it as much as possible.

## What is Earthy?

Earthy is a web application designed to protect our environment, in which, with the help of gamification, users get encouraged to suggest, organize or participate in various actions to save our planet.

This web application is based on the principle of a social network, where, depending on the impact of the idea or event created, the user receives points, which results in an increase in level and possibly in obtaining distinctions and badges.

The common goal of Earthy is to change the environment for the better, because any action, no matter how small, can positively influence the environment around us. We want to encourage users to inspire and support each other, because only in this way can we complete this mission, of humanity.

## Technologies used

As technologies, Earthy is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQuery, and AJAX along with PHP, SQL, MySQLi, and phpMyAdmin for databases.

## Stability

Earthy is posted online, meaning that the user only needs an internet connection to use it - https://earthy-website.herokuapp.com/

For a pleasant experience, it is recommended to use the application in the Google Chrome browser, since the full compatibility with other types of browsers will be optimized later.

## Security and Testing

Earthy has been tested long enough to find a majority of bugs that have been fixed. Starting from the existence of possibilities of abusing the application, to preventing SQL injections, with a lot of work, Earthy has managed to reach the stage it is at the moment.

## Interface

The design of the application is very simple and pleasing to the eye because Earthy hides many subtle transitions and hover effects that give a clean and yet interesting look: 
- The buttons have a push effect similar to real-life interactions.
- Links in the navigation bar, access to various items, etc. have color-changing, highlighting effects, all of which are characterized by different smooth transition effects whose time varies from 0.2s - 1s.
